# Foxydownloader

Script to download SGF-Files from Fox Weiqi (fixing the strange Komi format of Fox).

## Requirements
- python 3.*
- the module `simple-term-menu`
  ``` pip install simple-term-menu ```
  Note that this module doesn't work in Windows terminals. If you are using Windows it's best to us this script from the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

## Installation
It suffices to download the script or clone it to your pc:
``` git clone https://github.com/mboehm271/foxydownloader ```

## Usage 
``` python /path/to/foxydownloader.py ```
